### Sample Usage

>The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it. Then the program asks the user for input k (positive integer) and reads it. Then the program asks the user to provide N (x, y) points (one by one) and reads all of them: first: x value, then: y value for every point one by one. X and Y are the real numbers. In the end, the program asks the user for input X and outputs: the result (Y) of k-NN Regression if k <= N, or any error message otherwise. The basic functionality of data processing (data initialization, data insertion, data calculation) should be done using Numpy library as much as possible (note: you can combine with OOP from the previous task).

`python3 module6_knn-regr.py`

```
Enter N (number of points): 5
Enter k: 2
Enter points (x then y):
1
2
3
4
5
1
4
5
3
4
Enter query X: 4
Predicted Y: 4.5
```
>The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it. Then the program asks the user to provide N numbers (one by one) and reads all of them (again, one by one). In the end, the program asks the user for input X (integer) and outputs: "-1" if there were no such X among N read numbers, or the index (from 1 to N) of this X if the user inputted it before. The basic functionality of data processing (data initialization, data insertion, data search) should be done via Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm (i.e. using Classes)

`python3 module5_call.py`

```
Enter the number of elements (N): 5
Enter number 1: 2
Enter number 2: 0
Enter number 3: -1
Enter number 4: 2
Enter number 5: 4
Enter the number to search for (X): -1
3
```

`python3 module5_oop.py`

```
Enter the number of elements (N): 5
Enter number 1: 2
Enter number 2: 0
Enter number 3: -1
Enter number 4: 2
Enter number 5: 4
Enter the number to search for (X): 3
-1
```

In the end, the program asks the user for input X (integer) and outputs: "-1" if there were no such X among N read numbers, or the index (from 1 to N) of this X if the user inputed it before.

`python3 module4.py`

```
Enter N (positive integer): 5
Enter number 1: 2
Enter number 2: 0
Enter number 3: -1
Enter number 4: 2
Enter number 5: 4
Enter X (integer): 2
1
